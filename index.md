Starting Fall 2017, Stat 244 and Stat 380 will be using R software for all laboratory lessons and exercises. This page contains the weekly laboratory materials. 

[R](<https://cran.r-project.org/>) is an open source (free) software for statistical computing and graphics. More information on R in this [page](<http://www.siue.edu/~jpailde/Intro_to_R.html>).

[RStudio](<https://www.rstudio.com/>) is a popular front-end for R, giving you a console, a scripting window, a graphics window, and an R workspace, among other options.

### Directions

* Read the weekly lessons first and try out the R codes before answering the week's exercise.

* Download the week's exercise file and open the file using RStudio. Right click the link and "Save as..." to your desktop. In some cases you might need to change the file extension to .rmd

* This file type is called RMarkdown and is used widely to share and collaborate R outputs. More information is found on this [page](<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html>).

    - Open the file using RStudio.
    - Write your R code inside the [code chunks](<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html>) after each question.
    - Write your answer comments after the `#` sign.
    - To generate the word document output, click the button `Knit` and wait for the word document to appear.
    - RStudio will prompt you (only once) to install the `knitr` package.

* Submit your completed laboratory exercise using Blackboard's Turnitin feature. Your Turnitin upload link is found on your [Blackboard](<https://bb.siue.edu/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabAction?tab_tab_group_id=_35_1>) course shell under the Laboratory folder.
